Hello there, if you're actually reading this, I appreciate you.

I am currently an independent self-taught developer (though I can't say I'm amazing)

I've been coding as a hobby for about 6 years (off and on)

My plan/goal is to make various mobile games, and eventually branch off to console/pc.

Currently in the process of making discord bots to continue to grow my hobby.

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and NodeJS

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Unreal Engine 4/5 Mobile Games

📫 How to reach me: https://discord.gg/MDFhXT4aMz (My brainstorming Discord)
All of my bot project links can also be found in this discord.
